This file serves as a placeholder for the default event image.

When no event image is provided, the application will fall back to a default image.

To add a default image:
1. Place your default event image file in this public directory
2. Name it 'default-event-image.jpg' 
3. The image will automatically be used when events don't have specific images

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Dimensions: 1200x600 pixels (2:1 aspect ratio)
- File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading
- Content: Generic event/celebration themed image

Alternative: You can also use an online placeholder service by updating the fallback URL in imageUtils.js
